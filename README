ioseqw - sequential write using various (f)sync options
=======================================================

Based on something I wrote to test synchronous write performance.

The record size and record count parameters are mandatory.

Examples
--------

Write 10240 records of 4096 bytes, to the default file 'ioseqw.out':

    ./ioseqw -s 4096 -c 10240

Write it to the file 'wazaa' instead:

    ./ioseqw -s 4096 -c 10240 -f wazaa

Write it using multiple sync options:

    ./ioseqw -s 4096 -c 10240 -t sync -t dsync -t fsync

Surprised how fast that completes on OSX? You'll want this on OSX:

    ./ioseqw -s 4096 -c 10240 -t ffsync

Which will use the F_FULLFSYNC file control (only available on OSX).
